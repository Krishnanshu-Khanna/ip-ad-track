**This challenge, requires a basic understanding of React, Leafletjs and JavaScript.**


Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

**Have fun tracking!** ðŸš€
